Concrete blocks can be installed without mortar by pouring flexible concrete mass into the cavities. In concrete blocks main GWP impact come from the use of cement.",

The CO2 emissions from the combustion of biomass were calculated as zero emissions. The influence of harvesting of biomass on carbon sinks of forests or soil was not considered.<br />\r\nThe emission values were also assessed for energy services for coming decades considering the targeted decarbonization of energy services.  The applied assumptions are based on the basic scenario for 2020 – 2050 presented by VTT and SYKE in PITKO project (Long-term emission trends) documentation.<br />\r\nGHGs of fossil fuels for building heating in decentralized systems were assessed for light heating oil considering the emissions caused by procurement and construction of infra in addition to combustion.  The specific emissions for biofuels were formulated by using the same factors as was used for chips for in the connection of emission-assessment of electricity and district heat. The assessed emissions because of transportation and manufacturing were added following the principles of EU REDII Directive (EU 2018). The specific emission factors for fossil fuels and biofuels for decentralized heating of buildings were assumed to remain unchanged throughout the period considered.<br />\r\n",

The CO2 emissions from the combustion of biomass were calculated as zero emissions. The influence of harvesting of biomass on carbon sinks of forests or soil was not considered.<br />\r\nThe emission values were also assessed for energy services for coming decades considering the targeted decarbonization of energy services.  The applied assumptions are based on the basic scenario for 2020 – 2050 presented by VTT and SYKE in PITKO project (Long-term emission trends) documentation.<br />\r\nGHGs of fossil fuels for building heating in decentralized systems were assessed for light heating oil considering the emissions caused by procurement and construction of infra in addition to combustion.  The specific emissions for biofuels were formulated by using the same factors as was used for chips for in the connection of emission-assessment of electricity and district heat. The assessed emissions because of transportation and manufacturing were added following the principles of EU REDII Directive (EU 2018). The specific emission factors for fossil fuels and biofuels for decentralized heating of buildings were assumed to remain unchanged throughout the period considered.<br />\r\n",

The CO2 emissions from the combustion of biomass were calculated as zero emissions. The influence of harvesting of biomass on carbon sinks of forests or soil was not considered.<br />\r\nThe emission values were also assessed for energy services for coming decades considering the targeted decarbonization of energy services.  The applied assumptions are based on the basic scenario for 2020 – 2050 presented by VTT and SYKE in PITKO project (Long-term emission trends) documentation.<br />\r\nGHGs of fossil fuels for building heating in decentralized systems were assessed for light heating oil considering the emissions caused by procurement and construction of infra in addition to combustion.  The specific emissions for biofuels were formulated by using the same factors as was used for chips for in the connection of emission-assessment of electricity and district heat. The assessed emissions because of transportation and manufacturing were added following the principles of EU REDII Directive (EU 2018). The specific emission factors for fossil fuels and biofuels for decentralized heating of buildings were assumed to remain unchanged throughout the period considered.<br />\r\n",

      "GeneralComment": "Expanded clay is a ceramic granular material made of natural clay. The share of clay is >95%. Clay and additives mixed with it are incinerated in a rotary oven at a temperature of about 1150 Celsius degrees. In the combustion, the clay swells and forms sintered 0-32 mm granules by the rotating movement of the furnace . Fuel consumption during the combustion process is the main factor Influencing the carbon footprint of expanded clay. The proposed value for expanded clay crushed aggregate is based on the EPD published by Weber in 2020. The representativeness is good regarding the Finnish construction sector.",

The crushed aggregate manufactured of recycled glass is used as light-weight and insulating material in infra structures and in building construction. Foamed glass is made of cleaned recycled glass, which is crushed to 0.1 mm grain size. After crushing, a separate flotation agent is added. The glass is heated and melted roughly at 900 Celsius degree. The added flotation agent makes the glass to swell. When cooled, the pulp hardens and crushes forming porous grains (pore content roughly 92 %). The material is crushed and sieved to achieve the desired grain size. Carbon footprint is especially determined by the type of fuels used for heating.",

Several panels of such “primary” LVL can be bonded by face-gluing in order to achieve an LVL product with larger thicknesses, called glued laminated LVL (GLVL). In Finland, LVL is produced by gluing 3 mm thick coniferous veneers. The indicator values were defined separately for two different densities 510 kg/m3 and 440 kg/m3. Average value based on the EPDs reported by MetsäWood and StoraEnso is proposed for the generic value of LVL. A separate value is also given for GLVL.

EPDs are not available for impregnated timber. The GWP value was calculated as the average calculated for the collected Norwegian results (->0,13 kg/kg and 71 kg/m3) and modified to better represent the Finnish manufacturing.

Several panels of such “primary” LVL can be bonded by face-gluing in order to achieve an LVL product with larger thicknesses, called glued laminated LVL (GLVL). In Finland, LVL is produced by gluing 3 mm thick coniferous veneers. The indicator values were defined separately for two different densities 510 kg/m3 and 440 kg/m3. Average value based on the EPDs reported by MetsäWood and StoraEnso is proposed for the generic value of LVL. A separate value is also given for GLVL.

Several panels of such “primary” LVL can be bonded by face-gluing in order to achieve an LVL product with larger thicknesses, called glued laminated LVL (GLVL). In Finland, LVL is produced by gluing 3 mm thick coniferous veneers. The indicator values were defined separately for two different densities 510 kg/m3 and 440 kg/m3. Average value based on the EPDs reported by MetsäWood and StoraEnso is proposed for the generic value of LVL. A separate value is also given for GLVL.

The dominating issue from the viewpoint of carbon footprint is the manufacture of polyethylene raw material. The proposal is to apply the same value as published by EPD Norge by Rani Plast. The value is in reasonable balance with the carbon footprint values published by some other manufacturers and the ecoprofiles published by Plastics Europe.

      "GeneralComment": "Ready-mixed concrete is made by mixing the main raw materials cement, water and aggregate in a controlled proportion (according to recipe). The composition varies, but simplified concrete recipe contain cement around 12% and aggregates about 80%. Chemical admixtures are used to improve fresh and hardened concrete properties. Energy consumption for concrete mixing is small, raw-material transportation in Finland is also reasonable. Main environmental impacts come from the use of raw materials, process emissions of cement (decomposition of limestone) and the use of energy raw materials. ",
